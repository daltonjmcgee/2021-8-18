### Resources and details

#### The Model
I built this simple donut in Blender following a tutorial from BlenderGuru on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4). I then exported it as a GLTF file and imported that into ThreeJS. For the wood that the donut is sitting on I found a free texture on the website [Poliigon](https://www.poliigon.com/texture/wood-planks-worn-33) which then was imported into ThreeJS as well.

The lights and camera as adjustable via the dat.GUI library.
